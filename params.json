{"name":"PHPJOBS","tagline":"PHP JOBS - Simple Task / Queue Processing","body":"## Welcome to PHPJOBS Project Home Page\r\n\r\nYou always wanted to add tasks into a queue and execute the tasks in this queue later independently than the moment you add those ? Then this library is made for you.\r\n\r\nWith PHPJOBS, you can :\r\n\r\n* Add new tasks composed of single jobs\r\n* Add new tasks composed of several jobs (job before, job main, job after)\r\n* Add new scheduled tasks\r\n* Show the tasks in processing [ShowQueue]\r\n* Execute the tasks in processing [ExecuteQueue]\r\n* Force tasks execution [ForceTaskExecution]\r\n* Show finished tasks [ShowFinishedTasks]\r\n\r\nOf course, **you can call your own functions** by doing a \"require\" when\r\nyou execute each task. When the Job is being executed, the function is\r\nfound and the job can be executed given your functions context.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. Copy **phpjobs_*.php** files to your root project as well as the **phpjobs** directory\r\n2. Watch the phpjobs_add_tasks.php file : all examples are available in this file\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Watch the files at the root of the project first.\r\n2. Add tasks containing simple jobs. Ex: download a file from a URL.\r\n3. There are already common functions available for execution : PhpJobs_DownloadFromUrl, PhpJobs_FileCopy, PhpJobs_FileMove, PhpJobs_FileDelete that can help you play with it.\r\n4. Show the tasks waiting to be processed.\r\n5. Execute the tasks in the queue independantly.\r\n\r\n_By exemple :_\r\n\r\n`\r\n<?php\r\nrequire 'req_header.php'; // Contains the function YourFunction($param1, $param2)\r\n\r\nrequire_once 'phpjobs/phpjobs_tasks_manager.php';\r\n\r\n$job1 = new Job('PhpJobs_DownloadFromUrl',array('http://www.google.fr/images/srpr/logo11w.png','store/google.png'));\r\nPhpJobs_AddTaskToQueue(\"Download Google logo\", PHPJOBS_PRIORITY_NORMAL, $job1);\r\n\r\n$job2 = new Job('YourFunction',array('param1,'param2'));\r\nPhpJobs_AddTaskToQueue(\"Call to my function\", PHPJOBS_PRIORITY_NORMAL, $job2);\r\n\r\n?>\r\n`\r\n\r\nFeel free to add more features to this library.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\nUses Apache log4php library with rolling files.\r\nReady to use one file per day, or even syslog if needed.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPlease full request features or contributions to @jgarino.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
